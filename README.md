## Known limitations

* Avoid to cancel a download in progress: (IN PROCESS TO FIX IT)

    If you cancel a download in progress, next time you try to download it you will not be allowed to do it because ishare2 will recognize it already exists in the server
    
    In this case, you will have to manually remove it in order to be able to restart the download
