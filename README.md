## Useful information

    1) For problems, use our Telegram Channel describing your problem and sending a screenshot and/or a video
    2) For new files to be uploaded, you can use our Telegram Channel too. In this case, you can send or ask for new images to be uploaded
    3) Using ishare2 upgrade will result in upgrading this utility (ishare2). It will not upgrade your PNETLab Ubuntu VM version
    4) If CiscoIOUKeygen.py, iourc and/or keepalive.pl files in /opt/unetlab/addons/iol/bin/ are deleted, you can recover them by using ishare2 relicense. This will not affect images in there
    Also, this command when used, will generate a new license file called "iourc", needed for bin files
    5) Don't cancell a download. In case you do it, you will have to remove incomplete files or folders manually
    6) The main difference between ishare2 labs and ishare2 mylabs is that, in the first case, the folder used is the one PNETLab creates when you download a lab from the store and in the second case you are able to select any folder you want in order to download labs

[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/pnetlabrepo/ishare2/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## How to upgrade your PNETLab server

- Upgrade from v4.2.10 to v5.0.1: [Instructions](https://github.com/pnetlabrepo/ishare2/tree/main/upgrades/to_5.0.1)

## Known limitations

1) Avoid to cancel a download in progress: (BUG FOUND AND TRYING TO FIX IT)

    If you cancel a download in progress, next time you try to download it you will not be allowed to do it again because ishare2 will recognize that it already exists in the server.
    
    In this case, you will have to manually remove it in order to restart the download
