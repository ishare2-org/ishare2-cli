## How to use ishare2

## Search for images

### Search by name

You can search for images by simply typing the name of the image you want to search for using the following syntax:

```bash
ishare2 search <name> # Example: ishare2 search vios
```

Searches by name should be done taking into account the naming conventions used by emulators. For example, if you want to search for images of Cisco IOSv, you should use the following command:

```bash
ishare2 search vios # Will show all Cisco IOSv images available
```

For qemu images, you can follow the [conventions used by eve-ng](https://www.eve-ng.net/index.php/documentation/qemu-image-namings/). For example, if you want to search for images of Windows 7, you should use the following command:

```bash
ishare2 search win- # Will show all Windows images available
```

Other examples:

```bash
ishare2 search winserver  # Will show all Windows Server images available
ishare2 search linux      # Will show all Linux images available
ishare2 search forti      # Will show all Fortinet images available
ishare2 search palo       # Will show all Palo Alto images available
ishare2 search Licensed   # Will show all images with keyword "Licensed" in their name
```

>Note: You can also also search for images using common keywords for specific Operating Systems.
>

### Search by type

You can search for images by type using the following commands:

```bash
ishare2 search all      # This command will show all available images of all types
ishare2 search bin      # This command will show all available images of bin/iol type
ishare2 search qemu     # This command will show all available images of qemu type
ishare2 search dynamips # This command will show all available images of dynamips type
```

You can narrow your search by specifying the type of image you are looking for by using the following syntax:

```bash
ishare2 search <type> <name> # Example: ishare2 search bin vios
```

For example, if you want to search for images of Cisco IOSv, you should use the following command:

```bash
ishare2 search iol vios # Will show all Cisco IOSv images of the type bin/iol available
```

For qemu images, you can do the following:

```bash
ishare2 search qemu win- # Will show all Windows images of the type qemu available
```

For dynamips images, you can do the following:

```bash
ishare2 search dynamips c7200 # Will show all Cisco 7200 images of the type dynamips available
```

## Pull images

In order to download images, you have to specify the type of image and id number using the following syntax:

```bash
ishare2 pull <type> <id>
```

Syntax for each type:

```bash
ishare2 pull bin <id>
ishare2 pull qemu <id>
ishare2 pull dynamips <id>
```

>Note: You get the id number from the search results ishare2 displays after running the search command.
>

## Download all images at once

You can download all images at once using the following syntax:

```bash
ishare2 pull all <type>
```

Commands for each type:

```bash
ishare2 pull bin all      # Will download all bin/iol images available
ishare2 pull qemu all     # Will download all qemu images available
ishare2 pull dynamips all # Will download all dynamips images available
```

>Note: This is not recommended because it will take a long time to download all images, you will use a lot of our bandwidth and you will probably run out of disk space.

## Show installed images

You can see which images are installed on your server using the following commands:

```bash
ishare2 installed all       # Will show all installed images from all types
ishare2 installed bin       # Will show all bin/iol images installed
ishare2 installed qemu      # Will show all qemu images installed
ishare2 installed dynamips  # Will show all dynamips images installed
ishare2 installed docker    # Will show all docker images installed
```

## Download images for a lab

ishare2 can automatically download all images needed for a lab. This feature is available for .unl labs (usually downloaded from the [PNetLab Store](https://user.pnetlab.com/store/labs/view)).

```bash
ishare2 labs          # Will show all labs available
ishare2 labs <number> # Will download images for the lab with the specified number
ishare2 labs all      # Will download images for all labs available
```

>Note: Feature not available for encrypted labs since ishare2 can't read the contents of those labs.
>

## Download images for a lab using a custom path

You can specify a custom path for ishare2 to look for labs using the following syntax:

```bash
ishare2 mylabs <path>           # Will show all labs available in the specified path
ishare2 mylabs <path> <number>  # Will download images for the lab with the specified number
ishare2 mylabs <path> all       # Will download images for all labs available in the specified path
```

## ishare2 GUI

```bash
ishare2 gui install
```

Control the ishare2 GUI service using the following commands:

```bash
