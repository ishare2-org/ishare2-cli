MESSAGE: Welcome to the new version of ishare2!
COUNT: 1

We've made a couple of changes to ishare2:
1. Mirrors rotation has been implemented.
2. MOTD is now displayed when a user uses ishare2. This will be useful for displaying important messages to users!
3. You can disable the MOTD by setting the environment variable MOTD to false.

Please report any bugs or issues to the ishare2 GitHub page: https://github.com/ishare2-org/ishare2-cli/issues or join our Telegram group: https://t.me/NetLabHub
