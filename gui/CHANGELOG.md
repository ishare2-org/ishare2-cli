# Changelog for ishare2 GUI
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. You can upgrade ishare2 GUI to the latest version using `ishare2 upgrade` and then selecting `option 3`

## [v1.0.4] - 2023-Feb-02
1) Modified: In this version, when a user looks for installed images, those images are now displayed with correspondant IDs and not with a table starting from 1. This was not causing any bug in previous versions. This upgrade just shows a precise version of installed image IDs. Also, Size and Unit columns were added in order to display more information. It applies to bin, dynamips and qemu searches

## [v1.0.3] - 2023-Feb-02
