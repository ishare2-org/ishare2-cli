# MobaXterm-Keygen-v2.py

### Installation
Download this script into Windows applying this command in cmd or PowerShell:
```batch
curl -o MobaXterm-Keygen-v2.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnetlabrepo/ishare2/main/mobaxterm/MobaXterm-Keygen-v2.py
```

### Useful information
1. Syntax for this script is as follows:

```batch
python MobaXterm-Keygen-v2.py <username> <version>
```
2. When installing MobaXterm, make sure installation path is one of the following because python code will be scanning them in order to know where Moba was installed:

```batch
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Mobatek\MobaXterm\"
"D:\Program Files (x86)\Mobatek\MobaXterm\"
"E:\Program Files (x86)\Mobatek\MobaXterm\"
```

   This allows the code to move the generated crack file to the MobaXtermÂ´s installation path and open the software for you when crack process finishes.
   
   If MobaXterm is installed in another path, crack file will be generated as well but it must be moved manually by you to complete the process.

```batch
python MobaXterm-Keygen-v2.py admin 22.2
```
